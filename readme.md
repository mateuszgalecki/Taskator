TO DO APP
         
Simple app that I made as a final project on Coders Lab bootcamp. Made with React, you can log in by giving a user name and Your workspace. If user or workspace don't exist, You create them simply by logging in. Then You can add Your tasks and send the tasks to other users from the workspace You're in. The app uses Google Firebase as a database.
